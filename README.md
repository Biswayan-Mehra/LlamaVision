# Assistive Technology for the Visually Impaired using LLama 3

This project aims to empower individuals with visual impairments by utilizing advanced AI technology powered by LLama 3. The solution comprises three key components: **Ollama Understand**, **Ollama Enable**, and **piLlama**. Each of these innovations focuses on enhancing accessibility through natural language understanding, device integration, and real-time streaming.

## Features

### 1. Ollama Understand
`Ollama Understand` is an advanced AI module that comprehends natural language inputs and converts them into actionable responses. It enables users to:
- Understand textual content through AI-driven text-to-speech.
- Engage in conversations with AI that understands complex contexts.
- Improve accessibility for reading materials, websites, and more.

### 2. Ollama Enable
`Ollama Enable` is a framework designed to integrate various assistive devices, enabling easier interaction with technology for visually impaired users. Key functionalities include:
- Voice-activated commands.
- Device control for smart home systems.
- Hands-free navigation using voice recognition.

### 3. piLlama
`piLlama` leverages Raspberry Pi 4 as the hardware foundation for real-time streaming and AI processing. This component is designed for edge computing, providing:
- Real-time streaming using LLama 3.2.
- Low-latency video and audio processing.
- Integration with wearable devices and cameras for real-world interaction.
